# Tower implementation roadmap

[README](../README.md) · [Phase one guide](guides/phase-one.md) · [Project standard](PROJECT_STANDARD.md)

This roadmap tracks all thirty proposals from both research lists. Release
4.14.0 delivered four measurement and submission additions. Release 4.15.0
adds operation forms and supported adapters for the other twenty-six. The
tables state the implementation boundary; an adapter does not imply universal
application, site, hardware, or workflow-engine support. The original phase
groups remain below as a navigation aid.

Open **File → Research and cluster operations**, or enter `:ops catalog`.
Read the [complete operation guide](guides/operations.md) for controls, every
feature key, project contracts, and action review. Read the
[validation record](guides/operations-validation.md) for automated checks and
target-system verification requirements.

Tower remains a terminal application. Optional adapters must not become
requirements for the core application. Scheduler actions require an exact job
identity and a reviewable scope. Missing evidence must remain unknown.

## Phase one: measurement and submission confidence

Release 4.14.0 implements four focused additions:

| Proposal | Addition | Release scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A03 | Shell-body correctness checks | Explicit local syntax and optional ShellCheck analysis; no script execution |
| A13 | AMD and Intel GPU telemetry | Optional command adapters alongside NVIDIA; preserve unsupported counters as unknown |
| A14 | Scientific array manifests | Explicit array-index mappings with validation and bounded reads |
| A16 | Sampling capability inspector | Separate Tower reads from upstream collection and show missing configuration evidence |

Read the [phase one guide](guides/phase-one.md) for supported controls and limits.
These four additions remain independent of the 4.15 operation workbench.

## Phase two: prevent avoidable failures

Implemented in 4.15 through the [cluster operations](guides/operations-cluster.md):

| Proposal | Addition | Dependency or important limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P01 | Storage readiness cards | Free bytes/inodes and generic/Lustre user, group, or project quota evidence; no directory walks |
| P02 | Edit pending jobs | One supported field per review; live identity/state checks and result readback |
| P03 | Existing array concurrency controls | Real array parents only; preserve Slurm's zero-means-unlimited semantics |
| P04 | Reservation and maintenance timeline | Available Slurm reservation intervals; private reservations and external notices can remain unavailable |
| P05 | Software-license inventory | Distinguish Slurm's inventory from the vendor license server |
| A05 | Slurm installation health checks | Read-only service and connectivity evidence; no automatic service restarts |
| A20 | Recover retained batch scripts | Respect scheduler retention and permissions; never substitute the current local script |
| A19 | Allocation shell and step attachment | Explicit terminal handoff, exact allocation, minimal requested resources, and clean return |

## Phase three: reproducible and scientifically valid runs

Implemented in 4.15 through the [science operations](guides/operations-science.md):

| Proposal | Addition | Dependency or important limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A01 | Recreate software environments | Hash-locked Python recreation bundle, optional immutable Apptainer identity, explicit compute-host evidence; no installation from Tower |
| A02 | CPU, NUMA, and GPU placement verification | Allocation-process evidence through bounded probes; requested and observed placement remain separate |
| A04 | Scientific acceptance tests | Project-defined tolerances; missing results cannot pass |
| A07 | Statistical comparisons | Independent experimental units, explicit pairing, uncertainty, and small-sample limits |
| A08 | Verified intermediate-result reuse | Verify declared identity, dependency/output hashes, and scientific acceptance before copying to a new directory |
| A15 | Dependency-chain repair | Preserve successful branches; report partial application of non-transactional scheduler changes |

## Phase four: durable campaigns and data movement

Implemented in 4.15 through the [campaign operations](guides/operations-campaigns.md)
and [service operations](guides/operations-services.md):

| Proposal | Addition | Dependency or important limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S01 | Checkpoint-aware recovery | Declared complete checkpoint, verified hash and compatibility, explicit reviewed restart; no automatic application checkpoint discovery |
| S03 | Persistent monitoring service | Linux read-only queue/accounting service, single writer, atomic snapshots, reconnect and restart reconciliation |
| S04 | Input staging and verified output return | Declared mounted-file transfers, streamed hashes, no-clobber publication, resumable receipts, keep-source retention |
| A06 | Adaptive parameter searches | Bounded discrete exploration and local improvement with durable trial budgets; infrastructure failures remain distinct |
| A09 | Short-task packing | Declared logical tasks in exclusive Slurm steps, resource budgets, separate logs, durable task receipts |
| A10 | Elastic Dask worker pools | Optional dask-jobqueue controller with owned scaling, queued/connected evidence, persistent lifecycle |
| A11 | Workflow-engine connectors | Native Nextflow trace and Snakemake DAG/runtime observation; the engine retains retry, resume, and cancellation ownership |
| A12 | Heterogeneous allocations | Component resource requests, coupled `srun` launch, reviewed submission; site support required |

Tower already has reviewed workflow execution and durable submission receipts.
These proposals extend their scope. They do not describe those existing
capabilities as missing.

## Phase five: scale and infrastructure diagnosis

Implemented in 4.15 through the [scale diagnostics](guides/operations-scale.md):

| Proposal | Addition | Dependency or important limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S02 | Distributed bottleneck explorer | Rank/phase JSON and Darshan POSIX text exports; no native binary profiler attachment |
| S05 | Concurrent multi-cluster workspace | On-demand queue/history snapshots, exact source/attempt identity, bounded readers and isolated failure |
| A17 | Historical infrastructure-incident correlation | Permission-aware node events; an overlap is evidence, not proof of cause |
| A18 | Energy per useful result | Distinguish job, node, and device attribution; include failed attempts in campaign totals |

## Separate 5.0 proposal: on-demand stack tracing

The live stack tracer remains a separate design proposal. Neither 4.14 nor 4.15
adds a Trace button or attaches a debugger. The planned direction is an explicit per-job
Details action backed by runtime-specific, node-local collection. It must bind
results to a job attempt, node, process ID, and process start time; report
permission and runtime limits; and keep collection outside the UI thread.

## Compatibility and validation gates

Every implementation phase must account for interactions with existing controls:

- Publish immutable or isolated collector results. UI movement must not start
  filesystem reads, scheduler commands, or profiler work.
- Preserve the selected job and execution attempt across source refreshes.
  Results from an earlier selection must not replace the current view.
- Keep collection intervals, display windows, and source production rates
  separate. Faster reads cannot promise faster upstream measurements.
- Reuse shared readers and bounded caches. Invalidate them when identity,
  content, configuration, or adapter selection changes.
- Keep missing, unsupported, inaccessible, stale, and measured-zero values
  distinct. Remote and simulated backends must not silently read local data.
- Check the new controls with mouse capture, keyboard focus, overlays,
  selection, grouping, and Single/Multi worker transitions.
- Test malformed and oversized inputs, empty data, partial writes, source
  disappearance, command failure, stale results, and repeated actions.
- Run focused unit and integration tests, terminal rendering checks, and the
  existing regression suite. Document limits that require real hardware or a
  site Slurm installation.

Proposal IDs `S01`–`S05` and `P01`–`P05` identify the earlier substantial and
practical lists. `A01`–`A20` identify the twenty additional proposals. They are
tracking labels, not new commands or configuration keys.
