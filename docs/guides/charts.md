# Read and adjust charts

Tower draws charts with terminal characters.
Unicode curves use continuous Braille strokes with two horizontal and four vertical positions per cell.
ASCII curves use directional strokes. Filled area graphs retain their block presentation.
Both modes use the same samples, time windows, and scale limits.
Chart display controls do not change source data.
The separate polling control requests more frequent background measurements for an existing running job.

## Open a chart

1. Select a job in Jobs or History.
2. Open Experiment to load its application metrics, or use session resource data.
3. Enter `:chart METRIC`. Use the exact metric ID. Quote an ID that has spaces.
4. Use the arrow keys to select a sample. Use Home or End to select an endpoint.
5. Press Tab or Shift-Tab to change the metric. Tower selects the nearest sample
   time in the new metric.
6. Press Esc to return.

Use Page Up and Page Down to read rows that do not fit in a small terminal.

The selected sample shows its original timestamp, value, and reported step. A
display preference does not change these values. The chart stays attached to the
job that was selected when you opened it.

## Read a long Job series page

Open **Analytics → Job series** in the compact native layout and select the required job.
Use the mouse wheel, Page Up, and Page Down to scroll the metric document.
Use `:series-scroll home` or `:series-scroll end` to reach its first or last rows.
The job heading and navigation controls remain visible.
Up, Down, Home, and End continue to change the job.
Changing the job returns the document to its first row.

Point at the metric content when scrolling with the wheel.
A wheel event over Job history scrolls that browser instead.
Inside Jobs Details, use the Details column's normal scroll controls.
When a slider or directional button focus owns the keys, its controls take priority.

## Point at a metric graph

Move the pointer inside a visible metric plot with recorded data.
Tower draws a thin crosshair at the pointer.
The crosshair and selection outline use the active theme's accent color.
They update when you change the theme.
Unicode selectors use a Braille lattice with two horizontal positions and four vertical positions per terminal cell.
Crossing strokes combine their Braille dots in the same cell.
Their exact appearance depends on the terminal font.
The guide preserves the graph's background and has no black outline.
At an intersection, the original curve or annotation glyph and its style remain unchanged.
The selector draws only in unoccupied cells and does not punch holes in the curve.
The crosshair stays inside the measured plot, outside its labels and controls.
It marks the pointer's coordinates and does not turn a missing sample into a measurement.

The crosshair moves to the latest reported terminal cell immediately.
Only its Braille dot phase moves within that cell, over at most 24 ms.
This transition is visual only. Mouse events and selected bounds still use whole terminal cells.
The lattice does not increase mouse accuracy or measurement precision.
ASCII and reader modes use static `.` strokes with `+` intersections.
Set `"animations": false` in JSON, or `animations = false` in TOML, to disable easing.
The Unicode selector remains available without motion.
You can also open `:settings`, disable **Interface animations**, and apply the settings.
That setting controls selector easing as well as completion motion.

Hover uses the published graph geometry.
It does not reload the source, change the selected job, or rasterize the curve again.
Easing repaints the cached overlay instead of replaying queued mouse events.
The terminal must report mouse movement.
Use `:terminaltest` when movement reports are missing.

## Follow a running metric

A running job can show a Live control and two adjacent sliders above each metric.
The first slider selects the display window. The second selects the sampling interval.
Each metric has its own request. A curve and its filled companion share the same controls.

1. Open the exact running job's metric view.
2. Click **Live off** to enable Live.
3. Drag the first slider toward the left for 30 seconds, or toward the right for one second.
4. Read the duration beside the toggle. Wider rows label the first slider **Delta**.
5. Drag the second slider toward the left for five-second polling, or toward the right for 500-millisecond polling.
6. Read **Set** for this slider's request and **Poll** for the shared effective interval.
7. Click **Live ON** to return to the ordinary retained view.

**Expected result:** Live displays the interval from the dashboard's current time minus the chosen duration to its current time.
The window slider uses logarithmic steps between `30s` and `1s`.
The polling slider uses logarithmic steps between `5s` and `500ms`.
Subsecond axes show fractional seconds in their timestamp labels.
Selected time intervals use relative offsets with adaptive `s`, `ms`, or `us` units and an exact start-time anchor.
Labels use available terminal space and do not imply a finer source cadence.
Each metric retains its own duration and sampling request. A completed job has no active Live or polling controls.
Control rows adapt to the available terminal width.
Compact rows use `○` and `●`, or `o` and `+` in ASCII mode.
The empty symbol is off; the filled symbol is on.
Polling labels use `s`, `ms`, or `µs`; ASCII mode uses `us` for microseconds.
**Set** changes with the slider and identifies its requested interval.
**Poll** identifies the effective interval after global requests, other metrics on the same probe, and source limits are applied.
In a compact row, the effective value precedes the polling track and `S` precedes the requested value after it.
For example, `Poll 500ms Set 2s` means this metric requests two seconds, while a faster shared request keeps its probe at 500 milliseconds.
Changing **Set** in that case is still accepted even though **Poll** stays unchanged.
The footer also reports the effective interval.
These intervals do not establish the spacing of measurements produced by the job or guarantee that every read completes on time.

Select the slider with the mouse or directional button focus.
Use Left and Right for one slider step, Page Up and Page Down for larger steps,
Home for the left endpoint, and End for the right endpoint.
The window endpoints are 30 seconds and one second.
The polling endpoints request five seconds and 500 milliseconds.
Press Enter or Esc to leave slider focus.
Press Esc during a drag to restore that slider's previous value.
A page, source, geometry, or terminal-size change also discards an unfinished drag.
Right-click the window slider to restore 30 seconds.
Right-click the polling slider to restore its five-second request.
Each reset preserves the other slider, Live state, selected job, and graph zoom.
Right-click inside the graph retains its separate full-view reset behavior.

The control graph assigns a temporary token such as `m1` to each visible source.
Use these commands with that visible token:

| Command | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `:metric-live TOKEN on\|off\|toggle` | Change the moving display window state |
| `:metric-window TOKEN SECONDS` | Set a duration from 1 to 30 seconds |
| `:metric-window TOKEN focus` | Focus the window slider |
| `:metric-window TOKEN reset` | Restore a 30-second window |
| `:metric-sampling TOKEN N` | Select polling position 1 to 100; position 1 requests five seconds and position 100 requests 500 milliseconds |
| `:metric-sampling TOKEN focus` | Focus the polling slider |
| `:metric-sampling TOKEN reset` | Restore the five-second polling request |

Tokens are session controls, not project metric IDs. Commands reject a hidden or nonrunning source.
Previously set sampling requests remain active when their graphs move offscreen.
They belong to the exact job, source, and run attempt; completion, departure, or a changed attempt invalidates them.
Tower retains at most 128 metric identities. An evicted request returns to its default.
Live and sampling preferences do not survive a restart.

Live and the first slider change only the displayed interval.
The polling slider changes background read requests even when Live is off.
The Live clock requests at most ten scheduled display refreshes per second while an uncaptured Live plot is visible.
Input and scrolling animations can request other display refreshes.
A one-second window can contain no recorded observations when its source reports less often.
Valid empty axes retain their Live controls and time labels, but have no crosshair or rectangular selection until recorded data is visible.
Read the source-age and sampling-cadence note below the graph before interpreting a sparse window.
Missing observations and sampling outages remain gaps.
Current resource captures retain their timestamp precision.
Older saved captures can retain the earlier 0.1-second rounding.
A precise capture timestamp does not establish equally frequent source measurements.

During a rectangular selection, Tower holds both painted axis mappings fixed.
The sampler continues to publish new observations.
Automatic sample updates and changing data limits do not cancel the drag.
Cancelling the selection resumes Live.
Committing a valid time selection turns Live off and keeps its selected interval.
Enabling Live again clears that metric's completed rectangular zoom.

### Read the sampling limits

The polling slider uses positions one to 100 internally.
For position `N`, its requested interval is `5 × 10^(-(N - 1) / 99)` seconds.
The global control uses the same range with positions one to 50.
Its requested interval is `5 × 10^(-(N - 1) / 49)` seconds.
Each scale reaches both endpoints and gives every native polling position a distinct interval.
Tower uses the fastest request for an exact job and shared source; global and metric requests do not multiply.
Repeated adjustments do not compound or change the configured base.
The control shows both its requested **Set** interval and the shared effective **Poll** interval after source limits are applied.

| Source | Minimum interval for a faster metric request |
| --- | --- |
| Live CPU and memory probe | 0.5 seconds |
| Live GPU probe | 0.5 seconds |
| Local application metrics or CSV traces | 0.5 seconds |
| Remote application metrics or CSV traces | 1.5 seconds |

CPU and memory measurements share one job probe, so the fastest request for either metric sets that probe's interval.
GPU utilization and busy-mean curves share a GPU probe and use their fastest request.
Other jobs retain the global cadence and their own per-metric requests.
Reported application metrics can share a file reader; their fastest request sets the reader's interval for that exact run.
Reading that file more often cannot make the application write measurements more often.
The same limit applies to job-produced CSV traces.

Jobs, CPU and memory probes, GPU probes, and local trace reads start with a five-second native polling request.
Their controls cannot request more than two polls per second.
Other global sources retain their configured bases, adjusted by the global speed ratio from one to ten.
Remote file reads retain a 1.5-second minimum. Forecast and budget sources retain their 30-second minimums.
Source errors retain retry backoff. Command duration, worker limits, and disabled-source settings still apply.
Tower does not overlap reads to meet a shorter requested interval.
The graph footer reports the effective polling interval, source age, and any relevant producer limits.
Missing observations stay gaps. A short display window can be empty even when polling is enabled.

<a id="zoom-a-rectangular-area"></a>

## Zoom a time interval

1. Press the left mouse button inside the required metric plot.
2. Keep the button pressed and move horizontally across the required time interval.
3. Check the thin selection preview.
4. Release inside the same plot or its capture margin.

**Expected result:** The selected interval fills the graph's horizontal extent.
Tower calculates the vertical limits from the complete known curve inside that interval.
Both axes update to the new view.
The selection must span at least two columns.
A click without that width leaves the view unchanged.
After the drag starts inside the plot, its capture margin includes the axis labels and tick row.
It extends three terminal cells beyond that axis rectangle.
The margin is clipped to the actual visible pane.
Moving or releasing inside the margin uses the nearest plot edge.
The margin does not extend hover, initial presses, or right-click targets.
It cannot switch the captured source to a neighboring graph.
The operation changes the display bounds and preserves the original measurements.
Between adjacent known samples, a zoom can show their connected line even when
the selected interval contains no original sample. The sample count still
reports zero for that interval. Missing values and sampling outages remain gaps.

Time labels show offsets from the selected start, using seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds.
Tower selects the unit from the displayed span and the available space.
The note below the plot identifies the start timestamp and interval length.
Very small finite spans can use scientific notation.
Display precision does not imply a finer measurement cadence.

Hold Shift before pressing the mouse button to select an explicit two-axis rectangle.
Move to the opposite corner and release inside the same plot or its capture margin.
This mode requires at least two columns and one row.
It keeps the selected vertical limits instead of fitting them to the visible data.

Press `u` while pointing at the graph to undo the last rectangular zoom.
Press `0` while pointing at it to restore its original rectangular view.
Right-click inside the plot to restore the full view, including an empty zoomed interval.
This also turns off that metric's Live window. Other metric graphs keep their current views.
In Jobs Details, the selected job and marks stay selected.
Use `:chartzoom undo` or `:chartzoom reset` for the last selected or zoomed graph.
In the chart inspector, use the Undo zoom and Reset zoom buttons, or
`:chart undo` and `:chart reset`, for the current metric.
The existing `+`, `-`, time presets, and axis commands remain available.

In an analysis dialog, right-click outside the plot to clear its selected sample or event row.
This also clears the sample interval when the chart inspector is open.
The job, marks, metric, source, and dialog remain open.
Use the arrows or click a row to select again.
An event action or sample-interval anchor requires that explicit selection.
Right-click inside the plot still resets the graph.

Each zoom belongs to an exact metric, source, job, and run attempt.
Another job cannot inherit it.
Zooms are session display state; they do not change files or sampler intervals.
Tower retains at most 128 zoom entries and 16 undo steps per entry.

Press Esc before release to discard the preview.
Moving beyond the margin discards the preview. A later release cannot commit it.
Changing the page, job, source, axis mode, panel geometry, or terminal size cancels capture.
Opening a menu, dialog, or startup preview cancels it too.
A missing release times out after 15 seconds.
Cancellation keeps the previous completed zoom.
On a logarithmic graph, Shift-drag uses that graph's logarithmic coordinates.

## Time window

Press `t` to change the time window. The control row shows these presets:

| Preset | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `5m` | Show the last five minutes of retained samples. |
| `30m` | Show the last thirty minutes of retained samples. |
| `2h` | Show the last two hours of retained samples. |
| `all` | Show all retained samples. |

Use `:chart preset 5m`, `:chart preset 30m`, `:chart preset 2h`, or
`:chart preset all` to select a preset directly. Use `:chart window SECONDS` for
a custom window. Tower accepts a positive duration of up to 365 days. A preset
does not load samples that are outside the retained history.

Use `+` or `-` to change the zoom. Use `[` or `]` to move the time window. Use
`:chart zoom FACTOR` for a factor from 1 to 1024. Use `:chart pan FRACTION` for a
position from 0 to 1. Zero selects the beginning; one selects the end.

<a id="feature-42"></a>

## Axis scale

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `a` or `:chart axis auto` | Calculate a linear scale from the visible data. |
| `:chart axis fixed LOW HIGH` | Use the specified linear limits. |
| `g` or `:chart axis log` | Calculate a base-10 logarithmic scale. |
| `:chart axis log LOW HIGH` | Use positive logarithmic limits. |

The lower limit must be less than the upper limit. Both limits must be finite.
For a logarithmic axis, both limits must be positive.

Tower labels the active scale. It shows how many visible values are outside
fixed limits. On a logarithmic axis, zero and negative samples are undefined.
Tower draws a gap for these samples and shows their count. The original values
remain available in the sample inspector and interval statistics.

<a id="feature-43"></a>

## Preserve spikes

When samples share a terminal column, Tower retains the first, minimum, maximum,
and last known values in source order. This envelope preserves short spikes.
Unicode curves draw the range with continuous two-by-four Braille strokes. ASCII curves use
`/`, `\`, `-`, `:`, and `+`; an isolated sample uses `.`. If a bucket contains an unknown sample, the bucket stays
unknown. Tower does not draw a bridge through that bucket or a detected outage.
It connects known samples without smoothing their values. Fixed or zoomed
vertical bounds clip a crossing line. A segment wholly outside those bounds stays
blank instead of appearing as a flat measurement on the scale edge.
Straight segments join adjacent known observations; they do not create new measurements.
The same curve renderer serves dashboard, resource, and inspector graphs.

<a id="feature-44"></a>

## Sample interval

1. Move to the first sample of interest.
2. Press `r` to set the start of the interval.
3. Use the arrow keys to move to its end. Tower highlights the selected chart
   interval. The statistics change as you move.
4. Press `r` again to finish the selection.

Use `:chart range FIRST LAST` to select two visible sample numbers. Numbering
starts at one. Endpoints are included. Use `:chart range clear` to remove the
selection. The interval is attached to the metric ID and source timestamps.

Tower reports the known sample count, missing sample count, minimum, median,
mean, maximum, and the 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles. Percentiles use linear
interpolation between sorted known samples. The mean uses finite arithmetic
that avoids overflow for extreme values.

Sample coverage is the fraction of selected samples with a known value. Time
coverage is the fraction of the interval covered by adjacent known samples
within 2.5 median sampling intervals. Tower calculates the median cadence from
the complete retained series. It does not fill gaps. A single sample has no
measurable time interval, so its time coverage is unavailable.

<a id="feature-45"></a>

## Observed events

The `Events e` strip marks observed events at their actual timestamps. A diamond
in Unicode mode, or an asterisk in ASCII mode, indicates more than one event in
the same terminal column. Only events for the chart's job and global observed
events are eligible. Resource samples are not repeated as event markers.

Press `e` or enter `:chart events` to open the event picker. Use the arrow keys,
Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down to select an event. Press Enter to open its
exact job or cited source file. Press Esc to return to the chart. Use
`:chart event NUMBER` to open an event directly. The picker shows the full event
numbers, source paths, and original line numbers when they are available.

Use `:chart events off` to hide the strip. Use `:chart events on` to show it.

Phase changes, alerts, checkpoints, and log events appear only when a published
observation includes a timestamp. Tower does not infer earlier phase changes or
checkpoint times. If an event has a source path but no original line number,
Tower opens the exact file and reports that its exact line is unavailable.

<a id="feature-46"></a>

## Comparison scales

Enter `:diff JOBID JOBID` to compare two jobs. You can supply up to six IDs.
Resource curves align on each job's first observed sample.

Shared scales are on by default. Each metric uses the same vertical limits for
every compared job. Press `s` to toggle between shared and independent limits.
You can also use `:chart shared on` or `:chart shared off`. The comparison shows
the active setting. A fixed scale for a metric applies to all its curves.

Tower compares measurements of the same metric. It does not combine CPU,
memory, and GPU values into one scale. If a job has no measured samples, Tower
shows that condition instead of drawing a curve.

## Read GPU utilisation and busy mean

Job Series can show a GPU utilisation curve and an observed busy-mean curve for each available device.
Utilisation is the recorded busy percentage.
The busy mean is the cumulative mean of valid utilisation observations in the retained series.
It is an activity indicator, not FLOP efficiency, throughput, or the fraction of allocated devices used.
Missing and invalid device readings remain gaps and do not enter the mean.

Session telemetry identifies devices by `node:index` and retains utilisation, used memory, and total memory.
An application's job trace uses `<WorkDir>/logs/gpu-util-<jobid>.csv` with rows
`timestamp,index,utilisation_percent,memory_used_MiB`.
Tower keeps that trace attached to the exact job.
An index-only trace cannot establish which node or allocated device produced a reading.
See [GPU trace](../reference.md#the-gpu-trace) for the producer procedure.

The view shows at most four session devices and four trace indices.
The corresponding stable graph IDs are `gpu:<node:index>:rate`,
`gpu:<node:index>:busy-mean`, `gpu-trace:<index>:rate`, and `gpu-trace:<index>:busy-mean`.
These graph identities remain stable as observations arrive or the glyph mode changes.
Unavailable telemetry produces no invented utilisation or busy-mean measurement.

<a id="feature-47"></a>

## Metric display

Use the exact metric ID with these commands:

```text
:metricdisplay loss label Validation loss
:metricdisplay loss precision 4
:metricdisplay samples_per_second unit samples/s
:metricdisplay loss reset
```

| Preference | Accepted value |
| --- | --- |
| `label` | Printable text of up to 96 characters. |
| `unit` | An explicitly declared unit of up to 96 characters. |
| `precision` | An integer from 0 to 12 decimal places. |
| `reset` | Remove the metric's display preferences. |

These preferences change presentation only. They do not convert units or rewrite
measurements. Declare a unit that matches the reported data. Tower does not infer
an application metric's unit from its name. Session CPU and GPU percentages use
percent units. Session memory samples use GiB because their source bytes are
divided by 1024 cubed; their existing metric ID remains `Memory (GB)` for saved
view compatibility. The chart shows the original metric ID and the declared
unit. Exact sample inspection always retains the original numeric precision.

Tower saves labels, units, precision, axis limits, event visibility, and the
comparison scale setting. It does not restore a live chart, selected job, or
temporary sample interval after a restart.

## Data limits

- Tower uses published metric snapshots and in-memory resource samples.
- A metric chart retains at most 10,000 points. A dashboard has at most 64 metrics.
- An event picker has at most 512 observed events.
- Plot dimensions are limited to 2,048 terminal columns and 128 rows.
- The interaction registry holds at most 96 plots in one published frame.
- Rectangular zoom retains at most 128 source keys and 16 undo steps per key.
- Live and sampling requests retain at most 128 exact metric identities. Controls act on visible running sources; accepted sampling requests can remain active offscreen.
- Unknown and nonfinite values remain gaps. A measured zero remains a value.
- Sampling outages remain visible after zooming or compression.
- No rendering path loads a metric file or queries the scheduler.

## Python methods

These methods are internal application interfaces. A project integration should
publish the reporting schema. It does not need to call these methods.

### `tower.chart_tools`

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `finite(value)` | Check that a value is a finite number. Reject Boolean values. |
| `text(value, limit=96)` | Check printable, nonempty preference text. |
| `restore(saved)` | Return bounded, validated display and axis preferences. |
| `valid_axis(axis)` | Check the scale mode and finite limits. |
| `display(state, name)` | Return the display label, declared unit, and precision. |
| `preference(state, name)` | Return the source unit and explicit metric preferences. |
| `format_value(value, preference)` | Format a value without changing its numeric data. |
| `axis_values(values, axis)` | Return plot coordinates, limits, and the nonpositive log sample count. |
| `percentile(sorted_values, fraction)` | Calculate an interpolated percentile from sorted known values. |
| `statistics_for(points, full_points=None)` | Calculate sample statistics and observed-interval coverage. Supply normalized points in timestamp order. |
| `interval(points, state, name)` | Select source timestamps between the stored interval endpoints. |

### `tower.charts`

All drawing methods return rows of `(text, style)` segments. They do not perform
file or process I/O. Use `Glyphs(True)` for ASCII output.

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `resample(values, width, how="mean")` | Compress samples to mean or maximum buckets. Keep unknown buckets. |
| `envelope_points(values, width)` | Retain first, minimum, maximum, and last samples in each equally spaced bucket. |
| `fmt_num(value, unit="")` | Format a compact numeric label. |
| `time_axis(t0, t1, width, ...)` | Draw timestamp or elapsed-time labels. |
| `time_selection_note(t0, t1, width, ...)` | Identify the exact selected start timestamp and the displayed span. |
| `vbar_chart(g, values, width, height, ...)` | Draw a filled area graph with scale labels and optional timestamps. |
| `hbar_rows(g, items, width, ...)` | Draw horizontal bars with measured values. |
| `braille_chart(g, values, width, height, ..., curve_style="fine")` | Draw continuous two-by-four Braille curves or equivalent directional ASCII strokes. |
| `heatmap(g, matrix, width, ...)` | Draw a shared-scale measured matrix. Mark unknown cells. |
| `stacked_bar(g, items, width, ...)` | Draw a composition bar with a numeric legend. |
| `histogram(g, values, bins, width, ...)` | Count values in specified bins and draw horizontal bars. |
| `gantt(g, jobs, t0, t1, width, ...)` | Draw observed queue and run intervals. |
| `summary_line(g, parts, indent=" ")` | Join styled summary values into a row. |

`vbar_chart` and `braille_chart` accept `envelope=True` to preserve extremes.
Use `envelope=False` only when a mean representation is intended. Their optional
`axis_formatter` formats plotted coordinates; their `sample_times` and
`sample_interval` preserve actual time spacing and known sampling outages.
The internal `curve_style="blocks"` argument retains the older two-by-two raster for callers that require it.
It is not a user-facing chart setting.

### `tower.chart_interaction`

The interaction layer reads published plot geometry. It performs no file or scheduler I/O.
Renderers begin one outer frame, stage local plots, map them through the final layout,
then publish the visible geometry. A `Rect` uses exclusive `(top, left, bottom, right)` edges.
Zoom bounds use plotted coordinates; logarithmic vertical bounds remain base-10 logarithms.

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize(app)` | Create bounded transient pointer, capture, and zoom state. |
| `key(app, metric, source, jid=None, ...)` | Identify the exact source, job, and run attempt without truncating paths. |
| `begin_frame(app, width=None, height=None)` | Start the outer frame and clear pending geometry. |
| `mark(app)` | Record the first pending plot for a nested renderer. |
| `record(app, identity, metadata, ...)` | Stage the plot rectangle and axis bounds in local cells. |
| `place_since(app, first, dy=0, dx=0, clip=None)` | Translate and clip the nested plots after layout. |
| `take_since(app, first)` | Detach a layout candidate so discarded probes publish no plots. |
| `put_records(app, records)` | Restore the selected layout candidate's geometry. |
| `map_records(records, mapping, ...)` | Map plots through wrapping and sticky headers; reject disordered plot rows. |
| `publish(app, width=None, height=None)` | Freeze the final visible geometry and validate capture. |
| `hover(app, y, x)` | Update cosmetic pointer feedback from the published plots. |
| `active(app)` | Report whether a rectangular drag is active. |
| `capture_bounds(plot)` | Extend the axis rectangle by three cells, then clip it to the actual visible pane. |
| `tick(app, now=None)` | Cancel stale, blocked, or timed-out capture. |
| `cancel(app)` | Discard an unfinished preview without changing completed zoom. |
| `handle_mouse(app, y, x, button="left", shift=False)` | Apply plot press, motion, valid-release zoom, and right-click full-view reset. |
| `bounds(app, identity, scale=None)` | Return completed source-specific display bounds. |
| `captured_bounds(app, identity, scale=None)` | Return both painted axis mappings while the exact source has an active drag. |
| `autofit(app, identity, scale=None)` | Identify a time-only zoom that requires an observed-data vertical fit. |
| `undo(app, identity=None)` | Restore the previous rectangular view. |
| `reset(app, identity=None)` | Remove rectangular zoom for the selected source. |
| `handle_key(app, key)` | Apply cancellation, undo, and reset controls in plot context. |
| `command_names()` | Return the interaction command names. |
| `run_command(app, args)` | Apply `chartzoom undo` or `chartzoom reset`. |
| `feedback(app, ascii_=None, rows=None, overlays=())` | Return themed Braille selector strokes or ASCII fallback, preserving each painted cell's background. |
| `next_deadline(app, now=None)` | Schedule cached selector frames during the bounded 24 ms dot-phase transition. |
| `overlay(views, snap, app, width, height)` | Return no full modal overlay; feedback belongs to the current plot. |

### `tower.selector_glyphs`

These pure helpers place visual strokes on the two-by-four Braille lattice.
They do not change event coordinates, measured values, or source sampling.

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `locate(y, x)` | Map finite visual coordinates to a terminal cell and its Braille positions. |
| `glyph(y_slot, x_slot, horizontal=False, vertical=False, ascii_=False, fine=True)` | Return a thin stroke, combined intersection, or portable fallback glyph. |
| `interpolate(start, target, elapsed, duration=0.08)` | Ease the visual position without overshoot; use at most 200 ms for a custom duration. |

The selector passes a 0.024-second duration for its dot-phase transition inside the latest reported cell.
The helper's general default does not delay whole-cell pointer movement.

### `tower.metric_live`

This layer uses published exact-job status and chart geometry.
It changes display state and publishes bounded polling requests without performing source reads or scheduler I/O.
A filled companion uses the same canonical identity as its resource curve.

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize(app)` | Create bounded, transient per-metric duration, polling, and control state. |
| `canonical(identity)` | Share a resource area's Live identity with its source curve. |
| `fraction(delta)`, `delta_at(value)` | Convert between durations and the logarithmic slider position. |
| `format_delta(value)` | Format the duration in seconds or milliseconds. |
| `rate_fraction(value)`, `rate_at(value)` | Convert between integer polling positions and the logarithmic interval scale. |
| `set_running(app, identity, running)` | Publish exact source eligibility and stop a finished source. |
| `window(app, identity, now=None)` | Return the active display interval, or the captured plot's fixed mapping. |

### `tower.metric_sampling`

This layer maps exact metric identities to shared background collectors.
Its validation and interval calculations perform no scheduler or file I/O.

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `validate_rate(value)` | Validate an integer polling position from one to 100. Reject Boolean, nonfinite, and fractional values. |
| `interval(base, global_rate=1, metric_rate=1, ...)` | Select the fastest global or metric interval, with the source's lower limit. Native intervals span five seconds to 500 milliseconds. |
| `format_interval(value, ascii_=False)` | Format seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds; return `?` for an invalid interval. |
| `source(identity)` | Map a metric to its live resource, GPU, trace, or application-file collector. |
| `attempt(job)`, `matches(identity, job)` | Identify and validate the exact running scheduler attempt. |
| `research_matches(identity, context)` | Validate a reported metric's exact job, project, run, and published generation. |
| `sync(app)` | Publish a bounded replacement request snapshot to the background collectors when demands change. |
| `cadence(app, identity, rate=None)` | Return the effective shared collector interval, or an endpoint interval for a supplied polling position. |

`Sampler.set_metric_sampling(requests)` validates and replaces at most 128 exact metric requests.
`Sampler.sampling_interval(name, jid, attempt=None)` returns the safe interval for one job's shared source.
The sampler schedules those probes separately from jobs that have no faster request.

`ResearchHub.set_metric_sampling(requests)` replaces bounded application-file requests.
`ResearchHub.refresh_interval(context=None)` returns the interval for the current exact run context.
`ResearchHub.sampling_interval(identity)` reports that run's shared file-reader interval.
These methods change requests without reading files immediately.

### `tower.refresh_rate`

This layer stores the global polling position and maps it to requested intervals.
The stored `polling_multiplier` field keeps its existing name for compatibility.

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `poll_interval(value, maximum=50)` | Convert a whole-number position to a logarithmic interval from five seconds to 500 milliseconds. |
| `poll_position(seconds, maximum=50)` | Return the nearest bounded position for a finite positive interval. |
| `source_interval(base, value, *, source="")` | Use the requested interval directly for native jobs, live resources, GPU, and trace sources; adjust other configured bases by the global speed ratio. |
| `file_interval(base, value, *, remote=False)` | Adjust a file-reader base by the global speed ratio while retaining local or remote limits. |
| `cadence(app, source, base=None)` | Return the source's effective global interval without reading the source. |

### `tower.analysis_ui`

| Method | Purpose and result |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize(app)` | Create bounded analysis state. |
| `rows_selected(app, kind)` | Report whether the current sample, Timeline, Chart Events, or Evidence cursor is explicitly selected. |
| `resume_rows(app, kind)` | Restore row selection after deliberate navigation. |
| `context_click(app, y, x, button="left")` | Preserve graph-reset priority; clear local analysis row selection and keep the exact dialog source. |
| `restore(app, ui)` | Restore preferences and reject malformed saved values. |
| `save(app)` | Return persistent preferences without a live modal or job selection. |
| `command_names()` | Return the analysis command names for the command palette. |
| `dashboard_names(app, series)` | Return visible metric IDs in dashboard order. |
| `observe_metrics(app, result, jid)` | Record an observed, timestamped phase change. |
| `memory_series(app, jid)` | Read bounded in-memory resource samples. No file is loaded. |
| `chart_data(app, snap)` | Select published application metrics or session resource samples. |
| `viewport(points, state, normalized=False)` | Select the current time window. Set `normalized=True` only for validated, timestamp-sorted points. |
| `chart_rows(g, app, points, width, height, ...)` | Draw the chart, exact sample, scale, selected interval, and source status. Pass `snapshot` to reuse the published frame. |
| `chart_events(app, snap, times=None)` | Return observed events for the pinned chart job, with original citations. |
| `event_markers(g, events, times, width)` | Draw timestamp-aligned event marks. |
| `open_inspector(app, jid=None)` | Open an active, recent, or historical job by its exact ID. |
