A complete-file operation can reach files larger than the display buffer.
Read the operation's coverage and status before you interpret its result.

## Completion review and artifacts: improvements 48–50

Read the [operations guide](guides/operations.md) for improvements 48–49.
Read the [artifact guide](guides/artifacts.md) for improvement 50.

Completion states come from scheduler accounting evidence.
Silencing an alert does not remove its underlying condition.
Artifact inspection uses declared outputs.
It does not recursively enumerate a project.
